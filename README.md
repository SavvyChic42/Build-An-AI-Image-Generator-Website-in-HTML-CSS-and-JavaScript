Websites like Midjourney and DALL-E have gained significant popularity in recent months or years for their ability to generate creative and imaginative images using AI. If you’re a beginner web developer, have you ever considered creating your own version of an AI image generator website? The great news is that with the help of only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you too can build a website like Midjourney or DALL-E.

If you’re unfamiliar, Midjourny and DALL-E are AI image-generation websites. They use a machine-learning model to create images based on text descriptions. Users can input their desired image prompt, and these websites will generate a corresponding image that matches the description.<br>

In this blog post, I will provide a step-by-step guide on how to build your own website for generating AI images using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website will be built entirely from scratch using pure JavaScript. So, as a beginner, you can gain practical experience by applying your newly learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to real-world web projects.<br>

On this custom AI image generation website, users enter their prompt, choose the number of images they want to generate, and click the “Generate” button. The AI will then create images based on the user prompt. To download each image, the user can click on the corresponding download button provided.<br>

If you enjoy learning through video tutorials, the above YouTube video can be an excellent resource. In the video, I’ve explained each line of code and included informative comments to make building your own AI image generator website simple and easy to follow.<br>
